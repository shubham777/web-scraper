"Realme U1 (Fiery Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","I bought this phone on first sale. It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.

"Realme U1 (Fiery Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and

"Realme U1 (Fiery Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019

"Honor 8X (Red, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi

"Honor 8X (Red, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x

"Honor 8X (Red, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor
"
"Honor 8X (Red, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.

"Honor Play (Navy Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Guys, I am in a confusion for about 3 weeks on which phone to buy in the sale season. Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.

"Honor Play (Navy Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.
"
"Honor Play (Navy Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.

"Honor Play (Navy Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful
"
"Honor Play (Navy Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand👌👌Picture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.👍I saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k

"OPPO F9 Pro (Starry Purple, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","I was apprehensive at first buying an Oppo phone for the first time, as I always thought about Oppo/Vivo as camera/selfie centric brands (as they have marketed themselves like that). For reference, I might add more here that I have used Redmi Note 4 last year and Honor 7x early this year, both were good phones at their prices.I exchanged my Redmi Note 4 against buying Oppo F9 Pro, and got a decent exchange price of Rs.7,100/- (incl. extra Rs.3,000/-), which was a big incentive to go for this also.Now, about the phone Oppo F9 Pro, I am purely delighted. Not only, the camera is good, the overall performance just amazed me. Yes, I am not a much of a gamer, but I load too many apps, and must I say, it works exceptionally well.Although working RAM you get is near about 3 GB only out of 6 GB, but it does the job brilliantly. Not even once it lagged anywhere. It breaks the common myth about the supremacy of snapdragon chips over all else.Oppo F9 Pro has Mediatek chip and its great.The best part is the battery back up. First of all, it charges superfast, its unbelievable. It charged from 20% to 100% within 45 min. I charged it yesterday morning, its 7pm today, and its still got 38% juice left.Thank you Amazon, once again.

"OPPO F9 Pro (Starry Purple, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","Phone is not what it describes, expected with 6GB Memory. Games like candy crush and hay days get hanged and while u using any app and get a call there is no way u can receive the call, phone is hung. Worst is it gets heated up. Amazon is replacing phone after their technician inspected it and was able to replicate all problems. I only hope it is one off defective handset and not this model in particular.

I am using OnePlus since its launch .i.e Aug2014. I am waiting for 7 or later as I broke my OP3. Mine OnePluse One on Cyanogen is still much smoother than this latest gadget. Also, this is a temporary phone to me. So Oppo fans, please ignore my rating. Anyways , its a good deal but price little high. Should be 1-2k less, around 20K.Other than VooC and Camera nothing much impressive. Looks are good.

Apple iPhone X (64GB) - Silver,"I purchased iphone X on 26th Oct'18 and started using from 28th Oct'18. When i received the product, it was already opened which i informed Amazon representative but i was told that it is original product and it will not have issue. Within two days, it started giving me issue with network & WiFi connectivity. I again contacted Amazon through app but i was directed to Apple support. After talking to Apple representative, i only got indefinite answer like it could be software issue and i should wait till it updates but Amazon return/replace policy valid for only 10 days. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon.

Apple iPhone X (64GB) - Silver,"This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus.Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.

Apple iPhone X (64GB) - Silver,"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!)2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8.3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking optionWill come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.

"Redmi Y2 (Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","=> DesignWell, Xiaomi phone from 5k to 20 k have same body. Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well.

"Redmi Y2 (Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.

"Vivo V15 Pro (Topaz Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Fastest delivery by amazon. Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k

Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.

"Vivo V15 Pro (Topaz Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy

The delivery was on time and they also took the old phone (flipkart charges you for this process).The phone itself is quite nice. Lightweight, sleek, bright screen, fast processor and battery that lasts around 30 hrs on one charge for regular usage (watsapp, candycrush, youtube, music, short calls etc). The faceunlock and finger print scanner are fast. 6GB ram processor does make it super fast. The camera is also very good. I would recommend this phone for a budget conscious user

Comes with case and display, so dont worry about buying a new phone case and scratch proof display. Comes with full screen view. Definitely a must try product. Go for 6gb RAM one only.

"Vivo V9Pro (Black, 6GB RAM, Snapdragon 660AIE) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers"," I purchased the Vivi V9Pro a couple of months back and only with time I had been able to realize what a great phone it is. First of all one of the main reasons why I bought the phone is that at the current price point 6GB RAM and 64GB Storage is a good deal. Besides that the phone looks great, has good battery life and the display is good. One of the biggest downsides of the phone is that people constantly tell me that I am speaking softly. Possibly this is a one off case with my quiet frequently I have to speak up loudly.Now the reason why I am writing this review is that because I am mighty impressed with this phone's camera capabilities. The professional mode in the default camera app is a great feature that can help take your smartphone photography skills to unprecedented levels. I have attached a few clicks taken with the camera in professional mode with manual focus and light balance. The selfie camera also produces great results in proper lighting conditions. Now I never tried out the cameras in bad lighting conditions and cannot comment much on that aspect but when lighting conditions are good the images turn up great. The portrait mode produces admirable bokeh yet sometimes, especially when I shoot flowers up and close, the edges are not correctly detected, therefore resulting smudgy edges. Using opencamera app I was able to shoot videos in 4K at 30fps. The videos turned out stunning with great color reproduction and clarity. Once again those were under good lighting conditions. I have added a 4k 30fps video sample but I guess Amazon would downsample it. A 4k 60fps is lacking however which is usually found in more premium flagship phones.

The camera is 13 MP rear but with a lot of noise. Only daylight images are somewhat good. Night images with both selfie and rear camera are not good. The SD660 does a pretty good job. The software needs finishing touches. You can't delete a particular time of call from the log. Battery backup is as other phones. Phone heats up while watching a movie online or playing games.

"
"Honor View20 (Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Disclaimer : Bought Honor View20 purely for the camera. (i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,  1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.

"Honor View20 (Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.

"Honor View20 (Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.

"Honor View20 (Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) .

"
"Redmi 6A (Black, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage)","Pros: 1) Decent Video/audio recording with minimum distortion.  (noise cancellation is much much better than Redmi 5a)  2) Decent Camera for a budget phone.  3) good for Android smartphone beginners.  4) Can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging.  5) Fast boot.  6) Good touch response for a budget phone,  I find it to extra sensitive. hahaCons: 1) Bad Video quality for watching movies/ you tube. But I use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me.  2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out.  Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a. Ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.

"Redmi 6A (Black, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage)","Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.

Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me

Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space.Phone is quite light weight and very smart.

But unfortunately issues was still there.We contacted Amazon as it was under 10 days replacement policy directly from Amazon. They guided us to visit service center to get job deny job sheet from them ( according to them it was a standard process & guidelines from Apple).ALthough it was very painful to visit service center just after three days of purchase of this handset. But we did it. After getting inspection from them they told us that there is no issue with device but problem is with sim card, although it was the same sim which we were using earlier in small keypad phone ( sound & network were amazing at my home & other locations).but still we changed sim card & used it for some days, but issue is still there.As per amazon we have to get job deny job sheet from Apple. As per Apple they wont give it as it can be repair after open the set.But how  can i allow them to open the set within three days of purchase.It is very painful, this is my third purchase of iPhone from Amazon.

A good phone for cost value proposition (Cant really complain if you get a smartphone within 10k)b. Good audioc. Fast charging2. Negatives:a. Terrible photo qualityb. Quality Video calling not supportedc. Developed touch and display issues within 2 months of purchase (Even a 10k phone should provide at least this basic feature of robust touch and display)

"OPPO F11 Pro (Thunder Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with Offer","First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.

Camera quality is not great.The box arrived in a sealed pack condition but the seal has sentences with spelling and grammatical mistakes, which creates a doubt if it is an original product. Also, the stickers on the box like - product details, VoLte, manufacturer details are manually and poorly stuck.The protective shield on the phone was improperly stuck, has air bubble below the shield and had fine finger print marks over it. The white box where the sim card ejector tool is fixed had fold marks which could be made out that the tool was removed multiple times from its place.Poor manufacturing quality in India.

"OPPO A3s (Purple, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","This is my comprehensive review about the OPPO A3S, 2 GB ram, 16GB ROM1. Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.9. speaker sound is impressive10, dual sim mode working fine.Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget.

Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,"NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.

Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.

Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!

Phones in the price range of 7k have better pictures nad screen quality with the battery. Really bad product from Honor. They should take this device off the shelves or sell it for 7999 with mentioning the camera as 5mp. Yes the camera is definitely 13mp on paper but the output is bery bad. I thought it was just because of the screen but when i check the pics on my laptop they look even worser.I am returning the device thankfully amazon did agree to it.

I mainly use the basic features and watch a lot of movies/netflix etc ecpecially while travelling. A full battery charged in a day is sufficient for 2-3 movies and online usage.

"Honor 7X (Blue, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","Phone is good, but no headphones.. why like that don't know.. battery is very negative. Just for playing music half hour in Gaana or Wynk, without internet (offline songs) it will consume more than 12% battery, and if you play PUBG only 60-80 mins, Battery will be empty. In ultra power saving mode, and normal mode, i have found, there is almost 80% equal consumption. For two three hours standby in ultra it consumes 5-6% battery without internet. In normal it consumes 7-8% without internet.

"Nokia 8.1 (Iron, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.
"
"Nokia 8.1 (Iron, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.

"Nokia 8.1 (Iron, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D

"Nokia 8.1 (Iron, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.
